## Features

- 🎯 Dynamic Island-style animations
- 🖼️ Smooth image transitions with blur effects
- 🔄 Scroll-based interactive animations

- 📱 Cross-platform compatibility (iOS & Android)

## Tech Stack

- [Expo](https://expo.dev)
- [@shopify/react-native-skia](https://shopify.github.io/react-native-skia) for hardware-accelerated 2D graphics
- [react-native-reanimated](https://docs.swmansion.com/react-native-reanimated/) for fluid animations

## Quick Start

1. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the project:
   ```bash
   npx expo start
   ```

## How It Works

The animation uses a combination of:

- Scroll-based interpolation for dynamic height adjustments
- Blur effects and color matrix transformations for visual appeal
- Dynamic positioning and scaling of avatar images
- Smooth transitions between states using Reanimated
